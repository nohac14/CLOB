## CLOB

This is an implementation of a Central Limit Order Book (CLOB) for trading equities. It should accept orders and publish updates on order book state changes or if trades occur.

It implements a Central Limit Order Book (CLOB) system, which simulates stock trading functionality by managing buy and sell orders placed by traders. The core of the project involves handling orders through an `Order` class, which stores the relevant details such as ticker symbol, trader, side (buy or sell), price limit, quantity, and order status. Traders can place buy or sell orders, and the system will attempt to match these orders based on the given conditions, such as price and availability of stock. The `App` class provides a simple menu-driven interface that allows users to test order formatting and matching functionality, while ensuring that orders adhere to rules like matching prices and quantities. The matching logic includes verifying that orders from different traders, on opposite sides, can be executed at a price both parties agree upon. Through the `matchTest` and `formatTest` methods, users can simulate different scenarios to test the matching engine. This project provides a foundational approach to building more advanced trading systems and showcases fundamental concepts like object-oriented programming, input handling, and condition-based logic in Java.
